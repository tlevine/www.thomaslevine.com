I doodled some statistics
[last night](http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Machine-Learning/events/170546362/),
with some alarming breaks for non-fires!

## Materials
Here are the
[slides](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tlevine/statistics-doodles/master/doodles.pdf),
and [here]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tlevine/statistics-doodles/master/formulae.pdf)'s
a more conventional write-up of the concepts I discussed.
The source codes for these two files are
[here](https://github.com/tlevine/statistics-doodles/blob/master/doodles.r) and
[here](https://github.com/tlevine/statistics-doodles/blob/master/formulae.tex),
respectively.

## Cutoff
The abstract indicated that I would discuss the following four statistics.

1. Covariance
2. Variance
3. (Pearson) correlation
4. Least-squares regression

I skipped the last of these because of the second fire alarm.

## Related things
There's a
[video of a similar talk](/!/statistics-with-doodles-sudoroom)
that I gave, and a
[drawing of a related concept](/!/higher-power-distance-measures/)
that some people brought up after the talk.

## Thing to remember
You can pretty much always draw math.
