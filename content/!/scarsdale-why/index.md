[data](/!/hip-data-nonsense/),
and I've recently been

[around](http://www.american.edu/americantoday/campus-news/20120420-SOC-Partners-with-Washington-Post-for-ScraperWiki-Event.cfm)
[journalists](http://allthingsd.com/20120623/scraperwiki-tries-to-turn-journalists-into-hackers/),
so I figured I could do some data journalism.

I grew up in and still live in [Scarsdale](http://www.scarsdale.com), a town
and village of about 17,000 people. Data journalism hasn't entirely caught on
in the big cities, so it's not a surprise that none of it is happening in
Scarsdale. So I figured I'd change that.
