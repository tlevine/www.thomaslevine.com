I have a bunch of fun printed things sitting at my parents'
house and not getting seen. This seems silly. Does anyone
want any? Here are some of the available things.

Designer pizza boxes

* [Paul Rand Pizza Box](/!/paul-rand-pizza-box)
* [Modernist Pizza Box](/!/modernist-pizza-box)

Trolling

* [Nude Jello Wrestling posters](/!/jello-wrestling)
* Notice regarding demolition that wasn't happening

Just pretty

* [Poster](/!/fcc-20)
    for a Free Culture Cornell meeting featuring a
    Richard Stallman quote.
* [Mind your p's and q's](/!/pbdq/)
* [Bunnies]()
    (Although they're shirts, I recommend against wearing
    them because they're not that comfortable.)
