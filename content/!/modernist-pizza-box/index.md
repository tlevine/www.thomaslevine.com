A high-end, upscale, and modern pizza restaurant has just
opened in SoHo (in New York) or some equivalently fancy
neighborhood. It uses only the most pure and authentic of
ingredients, and its visual design embodies these values.
The restaurant hires an expensive modernist designer to
design the interior of the restaurant all the way down to
the details. This is what the pizza boxes looks like.
