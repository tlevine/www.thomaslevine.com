title: Why does turning into a zombie seem unpleasant?
short_title: Zombie transformation
---
After having watched [Decay](),
I'm pondering why I would not like to be turned into a zombie.
There's something about survival of my current species, but
I feel like being turned into a zombie is particularly bad.

Being turned into a polar bear, elephant, lion would be less bad. Hmm these
animals are all magestic, big, strong and, I suspect, more intelligent than
zombies for conventional measures of intelligence. Let's consider something
that is less big, strong or intelligent.

Being turned into mosquitoes, termites or a snake would be similarly bad to
being turned into a zombie. Maybe it's something about them being pests.
Actually, maybe it's just the gruesome process of being turned into a zombie.
(I'm imagining the processes for these alternative pests to be as gruesome.)
If the change happened suddenly and without warning, it would be less bad.

Another part might be hostility to people. We've managed to prevent many things
from killing people, so let's consider other groups of people. I wouldn't want
to develop some mental illness that makes me want to kill people. Similarly, I
wouldn't want to be turned into a soldier or white-color criminal.

Maybe it's something about the killing of people being attributed to the human me.
Killing people would be less bad if I was a shark, lion or avalanche; people
might not know it was me, and even if they did, it would be clear that I had
changed, so they'd probably doubt that the human me would have killed people.

As another approach for looking at the importance of the hostility, let's
consider resulting things that we don't see as particularly hostile. Being
turned into a tree, dog or rock would be less bad.

I remarked that I've been using "more bad" and "less bad" to describe these
hypothetical transformations, rather than "good". What would be good?
I've been thinking that my brain would disappear in any of these
transformations, but if it didn't, some changes could be cool. Well most would
be pretty cool, but most would increase my risk of death unless people knew
that I was the transformed me. If my brain is preserved, the most appealing
changes seem to be the ones where I'd be less likely to die, like mountain,
banker and turtle.
