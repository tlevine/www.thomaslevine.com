The smoothies section of this menu from
[Cherrywood Coffeehouse](http://cherrywoodcoffeehouse.com/) is designed for
both beginners and intermediates; beginners immediately see the five smoothie
choices at the top and intermediates know to look at the bottom to "design
[their] own". Experts can order things that aren’t on the menu.

![Menu says "Smoothies", lists five types of smoothies, then has a "Design your own" section.](<%= item.identifier %>menu.jpg)

If you don’t know what I’m talking about when I discuss beginners,
intermediates and experts, read
