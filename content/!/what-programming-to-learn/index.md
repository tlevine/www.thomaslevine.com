title: What I think people who want to learn programming
---
Some people want to learn programming for the sake of it
rather than for a particular project. This is quite reasonable
today. blah blah




People often approach this by learning "Python", "JavaScript",
"Ruby on Rails", &c. These are all really broad topics, and
something something. I think people should learn things that
are immediately useful to them. So I came up with this list.


It's more focused on people who write a lot.

* A good text editor (vim or emacs)
* 


massive gap between people who are just starting and people
who know the stuff


### What is a text editor?
With a word processor, we edit the styled, rendered content.
The word processor saves this in a format that we don't see.
For example, we might edit a web page in LibreOFfice Writer
and save it as HTML.


When we "edit text" or use a "text editor", we are editing
the raw, unrendered code. We are separating the editing from
the rendering.



This is related to the conccepts of what you see is what you
get and what you see is what you mean.

Reference the LaTeX essay. Maybe.




Word processor stores information in a relatively complex file format
with all of the style information and whatnot.
