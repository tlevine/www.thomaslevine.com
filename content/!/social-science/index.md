This isn't anything new; your grandparents or religious text could have told
you the same thing. But today we want numbers and "science", so we have to
reinvent all of our grandparents' wisdom with today's fancy numbers.

On a related note, I like to see science/technology/engineering/math as a
religion. When we want to convince ourselves of a thing today, we frame it
in terms of this fancy smart-people stuff. I think it was the same in other
times, except that people were relating the arguments to other religious texts.
But that's a story for another day.
