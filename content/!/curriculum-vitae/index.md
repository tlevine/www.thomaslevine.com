title: Curriculum vitae
---
I wonder what the point of a CV is. If I'm not doing the conventional
academic thing, I don't really need the typical CV. But why is it desireable?
To some degree, it's a summary of a person. My website is also a summary
of me too, but it ignores some typical contents of a CV.
{:.webonly}

I think a CV is intended to make someone sound impressive. I sort
of don't like doing that, but I'm curious about what it would sound like.
And I'm applying to a graduate school (April 1, 2014). So here I go.
{:.webonly}

If you dare read this, keep in mind that I'm inflating things in order
to play the real-world game.

## Prior full-time employment
I was on the development team at [ScraperWiki](https://scraperwiki.com),
where I helped design and build data processing systems and infrastructures.
I also taught courses on the cleaning and analysis of data. (2012)

I developed the curriculum for [Zipfian Academy](http://zipfianacademy.com)
and taught the first class of students. (2013)

## Prior consulting work
I collected data about the locations of finance institutions in South
Africa (primarily) to assist the
[Microfinance Information Exchange](http://mixmarket.org) with
[mapping the financial sector](http://www.themix.org/publications/mix-microfinance-world/2012/05/mapping-financial-sector-south-africa).
They use these data to understand who has access to financial products
in order that people make more informed investment decisions regarding microfinance. (2012)

I developed and continue to maintain a system that streamlines
environmental advocacy efforts of the
[Gulf Restoration Network](https://healthygulf.org/). (2012--present)

I conducted early data engineering on the [DataPad](http://datapad.io)
data analysis product. (2013)

As part of [csv soundsystem](http://csvsoundsystem.com),
I did engineering and product management on [treasury.io](http://treasury.io). (2013)
