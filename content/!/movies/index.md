I tend to fall asleep during movies, so I prefer movies for which falling
asleep enhances them. Most of these are really trippy movies that get
even more trippy if you drift in and out of sleep during them. Some examples:

* Donnie Darko
* Serial Experiments Lain (if you watch a bunch of episodes at once)
* Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

But that's not the only sort of movie that falling asleep enhances; falling
asleep enhances the following movies for other reasons.

* Inception
* Clerks, Clerks 2 and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, watched in succession
* Snakes on a Plane

These lists are both quite short, so I'd love to hear any other suggestions of
movies that are enhanced when the viewer falls asleep.
