title: Disciplines as mindsets
---
I think that people usually see disciplines as being distinguished by their
methods, literature, and topics of study/work. For example, the plumber does
plumbing, the lawyer knows the law, and the chemist understands chemicals.

This manner of categorization didn't seem right to me. The study of plumbing
surely involves understanding the law and the chemicals, right? And how do you
draw lines between plumbing, electricity, chemistry, physics and architecture?

A few years ago, I started looking at disciplines as mindsets and languages.
And I think it's relevent that my thing at the time was "ergonomics".

## Ergonomics as mindset
I apparently know something about ergonomics, but none of the definitions ever
seemed quite right. The
International Ergonomics Association
defines it (paraphrased) as the scientific discipline (and associated applied
discipline) that studies how systems involving people work in order to make
the systems more productive and better for people.

All sorts of things get binned into ergonomics, like reducing errors by airplane
pilots, making assembly lines run more smoothly, making chairs more comfortable,
and keeping noise levels safe.
So it's nice that this definition isn't overly specific

But the definition is also too broad. The study of the interactions between
cancer cells and drugs is surely a scientific discipline that studies systems
with people in order to make people more productive and to make people healthier.
So is it ergonomics?

Here are a few views that I've had for a while, and I think they explain why I
liked ergonomics.

* People are rather complicated; telling them how to act doesn't make them act
    that way.
* Even though people are complicated, we can study how people act.
* My back and wrist hurt, and I don't like that.
* Measuring fuzzy things like emotions is a lot of work; I'd rather measure
    things that are easier to explain, like the positions of human bodies.

Ergonomics might be better explained as a mindset that includes all of this:
People are complicated, but we're going to study how they act, with some focus
on concrete, un-emotional things like work. It's sort of other
[social science](/!/social-science), but less emotionally loaded.
