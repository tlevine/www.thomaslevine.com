According to some ergonomics research, the location in which one mouses affects
the posture with which one mouses. Thus, the location of the mouse might impact
health. Some people have recommended that large keyboards with number pads be
switched for keyboards that are less wide or that have the number pad on the
left side because this might allow you to mouse in a better place. But I
couldn't find anyone who had actually checked whether that would happen.

To see whether it does, I videoed people and measured the locations in which
they place mice as a function of whether the keyboard they were using had a
number pad. What do you know? People placed the mouse farther from the body when
the keyboard had a number pad. It seems that the presense of a number pad
affects mousing location and in turn encourages relatively awkward posture.

Based on these findings, I suggest that people avoid using especially
wide keyboards, such as those with number pads. If people need number pads,
they can use separate number pads, which can be moved out of the way during
mousing, or they can mouse on the side opposite the number pad.
