Part of the reason for [my recent studies](/open-data) on open data
has been unclarity as to what open data really is. This unclarity has
recently become more clear to me.

As far as I can tell, open data is the phenomenon of multiple people
creating, sharing, and reading with the same data. We call data "open"
when anyone in the world is allowed to interact with the data, but the
same issues arise even if only some people in the world are allowed
to interact with the data.

## Open data in government
[This](/!/open-data-in-plain-english/) is my favorite video introduction
to the concept of open-data, at least in the context of government.

The general thought is that we can find data that can be released safely
and that releasing these data might allow new good things could happen.

Because the above video is focusing on governments who are trying to
start getting data out somewhere, it doesn't discuss more involved sorts
of sharing.  Different government departments, companies, and ordinary
people could all create their own datasets and assist in the collection
or auditing of shared datasets.

## Sharing data in general
You don't have to be a government releasing data to the public in
order to be sharing data. For example, if you use a lot of proprietary
data in an organization of at least ten people, your situation is
probably quite similar to that of this open data ecosystem. You have
enough different data sources that not everyone will know everything
about all of the data sources, so you'll come up with approaches for
storing all of these data, versioning them, finding them, and so on.
Francis Irving and Rufus Pollock would call this a
[data management system](http://blog.okfn.org/2012/03/09/from-cms-to-dms-c-is-for-content-d-is-for-data/).

While they don't share data with the public, large financial institutions
might have some of the strongest open data ecosystems internally.
[Bill Newport](http://www.datagotham.com/speakers/#newport) spoke at
Data Gotham this year about mananging data at Goldman Sachs. We attendees
were asked not to share what he had said, so I'll just say that they
were doing everything that I'd been wanting in the area of open data.
And I've heard similary awesome things about data management at
Bridgewater and JP Morgan.

## Concept of ownership
When a bunch of people are working collectively on the same dataset,
the concept of ownership changes. One person or group may initially
collect most of the data, but other people may continuously audit the
data, structure the dataset differently, or collect more data. We wind
up with something more like
[a cathedral than a bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/),
just as we do in free software, wikis, and other forms of free culture.

## Plan for sharing
Now that we are interacting with so much structured digital content,
we're finding some value in sharing it. Open data is about accepting
that there is value in sharing and collaborating on data and then
planning for this sharing.
