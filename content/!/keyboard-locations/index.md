title: Where do people position computer keyboards?
short_title: Keyboard locations
---
While studying how number pads relate to mouse locations [1],
I noticed people trying to move the keyboard around. They couldn't because it
was taped to the table, but it got me thinking. Maybe people move the keyboard
a bit to the left instead of just mousing all the way to the right.

I measured the locations of computer keyboards in a computer lab for a few days
to get an idea of how they are placed [2]. At first glance, it looks like they are
placed to the left on average and placed quite variably, but my measurement
instrument was a bit too imprecise for me to take much meaning from the numbers.
However, my qualitative impressions from looking at all of these keyboards as I
measured them match the above inferences.
