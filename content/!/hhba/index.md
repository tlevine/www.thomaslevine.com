I went to a [three-day party](http://mediaparty.hhba.info) in Buenos Aires this
past month. The first two days were
[talks and workshops](http://mediaparty.hhba.info/es/agosto2012/agenda/26/Agenda.htm),

I gave a talk on [how awesome I am](http://talks.thomaslevine.com/hh-ba-media-party-keynote/) and a workshop on
[cleaning data](http://mediaparty.hhba.info/es/agosto2012/talleres/56/Taller-18-De-la-web-al-spreadsheet-%C2%BFPara-qu%C3%A9-sirve-Scraper-Wiki.htm).
The latter involved no computers and no slides, so I held it outside!

I modeled an analog version of the
[Army Corps 404 Website Scraper](https://github.com/tlevine/wetlands)---what
it might have been like before the internet. I took volunteers to play the
a courier, an army secretary and staff/volunteers at an advocacy group. The
simulated advocacy group acquired paper notices about applications to build
on wetlands, archived the notices, recorded some structured information on a
table (with four legs!) and then tried to find notices that should not be
approved. I had no slides for the workshop, but here are some of my notes/outlines.

The third day was a shockingly organized hackathon. Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires has
a [website for discussing hackathon ideas](http://hackdash.hhba.info/dashboard).
And people worked on it [during the hackathon](http://hackdash.hhba.info/p/4443109)!
Anyway, [my team](https://twitter.com/titayna/status/247533822600699904)
[found](https://gist.github.com/3762741) references of money in court documents.

More importantly, I ate
[pizza](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerr%C3%ADn),
[milanesa](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milanesa),
[empanadas](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empanadas),
[dulce de leche](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulce_de_leche) and
[ice cream](http://www.unaltravolta.com.ar/).
