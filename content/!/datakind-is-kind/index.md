Today, the day after the "[Big](/!/datakind-world-bank)" Data Dive
[at the World Bank](http://datakind.org/events/dc-datadive-world-bank/),
I started pondering that I might like
these DataKind events because they attract nice people and that this might be
more important to me than helping non-profit organizations.

I posit that people attend DataKind events because they want to meet nice people.
Furthermore, I will suggest that DataKind run events that test this hypothesis
and that it consider this in its operations if this seems to be the case.

## Defining niceness
In case people don't have consistent definitions of "nice", you can think of a
"nice" person as being considerate, open-minded, thoughtful, non-competitive,
and calm.

You can also see "niceness" as epitomized by a wise old person who has retired
from her job but is financially stable.

For a more involved definition, see the "What inspires you to use your data
skills for good in your spare time?" section of 
[my data hero blog post](http://datakind.org/2012/08/data-heroes-tom-levine/).
You can also see niceness as equivalent to the concept of femininity put forth
by [Valarie Solonas](http://womynkind.org/scum.htm).

These definitions are all a bit different, but they all vaguely match what
I mean by "nice".

## My theory: DataKind events are good places to meet nice people.

### Data events events in general are good places to meet nice people.
People at data events seem to think more scientifically and more logically
and to think more about how people act (social science).
Data are used to learn things from empirical evidence, so people interested
in data probably like learning in general and might be more open-minded than
random people. Also, learning the math and other tools for
working with data takes some thought, so the ability to work with the data
implies a sort of mental ability.

This, too, can be bastardized now that we have a hip religion around data.
People with fixed opinions who would otherwise have used other means to argue
their opinions now include data in their arguments, not necessarily in any
statistically valid way. Also, businesses scare other businesses into buying
nebulous products to tame a supposed tsunami of data.

Still, I suspect that the people who attend data events are more open-minded
and reasonable than other people, on average.

### Volunteer events in general are good places to meet nice people.
Jake mentioned that he had gone to a few ordinary volunteering events and found
them to be attended by social groups for single people. I had initially figured
that this was because social groups for single people need arbitrary events to
attend, but I'm starting to wonder whether there is something more to this.
Maybe volunteer events in general are good places to make nice friends.

Because volunteer events don't provide any short-term, direct financial or
otherwise conventional benefit to volunteers, they must attract people who are
concerned about something larger.

Also, volunteers aren't paid, so volunteer events probably come up with other ways
to get volunteers to come. I think that typical volunteer events provide a
nice (social, relaxed, happy, &c.) atmosphere in order to do this. This matches
what I've seen at DataKind events.

This can, of course, be bastardized. For example, volunteer work can be used
as the first rung of a bureaucratic ladder, especially in the form of
interships or required community service, but I suspect that volunteer things
are nicer than non-volunteer things on average.

### DataKind
Data and volunteer events should generally attract nice people, but DataKind
data dives in particular are run in a way that makes participants feel good.
People are made to feel that they have accomplished something and that they
are having an impact on the organizations.

### CSV Soundsystem
CSV Soundsystem is another group of people interested in data for good, and
it is consistently well-attended. We normally bring our respective laptops
and work on separate projects, but it's not really a good place to work on
much; it's more like a party where we hang out. It has no formal direction
towards any obvious applications of data, but we have started working on
journalistic data projects after having hung out for several months.

### Stories from DataKind events
Here are some broad things I've noticed at DataKind events that should support
the above two points.

* People were getting emotional at the round-table discussion after the Big
    Data Dive.
* People use unusually few buzzwords at DataKind events.
* The person from DC Action for Children got emotional after the presentation
    at the data dive.
* The final presentations at DataKind data dives always make happy in ways that
    conference presentations and hackathon presentations ordinarily do not.
* People aren't competing at the data dives.
* Compared to volunteer events that I've attended, people at data dives are
    more open to changing how organizations work. (This should make sense;
    it is quite related to the nominal goal of the data dives.)
* People in Chicago started the Data Potluck. This is notable because of the
    emphasis on ordinary socializing rather than just on data.

## Limitations of my theory
I attended several DataDives, but I wasn't explicitly trying to figure out why
people had chosen to come to them. My theory might come more from my own
experience than that of other superheroes, so this motivation might not
represent the broader motivation of superheroes.

On the other hand, I've attended more DataDives than anyone other than Jake and
Craig, so it could be that my motivation does represent that of the larger group
and that my motivation is stronger or that my lack of a typical job has allowed
me to attend more of these events. Either of these explanations would indicate
that I'm a more extreme example of most superheroes.

Either way, I haven't looked for any rigorous research about my claims.

## Suggestions based on my theory
Putting everything I just said together, I suspect that data-divers/superheroes attend
partly because they expect data dives to attract nice people. Extending this,
I'm bothered that the social connections made at one-off events sort of end
there. I do want the projects to continue, but that's partly because I want
to see the people again.

DataKind has encouraged the formation of groups around data projects, but I
propose that it try to form groups of self-selecting nice people.

### Encourage decentralized socialization
The DataKind blog lets superheroes hear about projects and other superheroes,
but I would like to know more about what everyone else is doing or hang out
with them, without a strict emphasis on data for good. Maybe it would work to
encourage people to follow each other on Twitter or friend each other on Facebook.

### Hold frequent in-person events
If we want superheroes to socialize more, we should hold more events. And if
we want nice people to socialize more, we should hold more nice events for them.
DataKind started to do this with the DataKind group on Meetup, but I think it would
be more effective to hold an event that feels less businessy. Specifically,
I propose that DataKind hold a **picnic** when the weather gets warmer.

### Connection to DataKind's goal
This might seem tangential from DataKind's stated goal of allowing people to
use data for good, but I think it isn't. If I kept seeing nice data people,
I think I'd be more likely to work with them on data projects for good.

The formation of informal groups and their efforts towards data for good will
probably be harder to measure, so it might be important that these informal
groups be incentivized to convey their accomplishments with DataKind so that
DataKind can claim to its funders that this community-building has had some
sort of impact.
