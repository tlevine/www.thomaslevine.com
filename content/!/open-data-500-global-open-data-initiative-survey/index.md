title: Can we open our open data questionnaires?
description: I ponder whether GovLab and Sunlight Foundation are sharing data from their open data questionnaires.
twitter_description: Also, would knowledge that an open data questionnaire was going to be open data get you to fill it out?
tweet_text: '@GovLab and @SunFoundation, I think you should open your open data questionnaire data. http://thomaslevine.com/!/open-data-500-global-open-data-initiative-survey'

On September 19, I got
[this email](http://us6.campaign-archive2.com/?u=1a990feb5c&id=46f97c829f&e=f59483af9a)
from the [GovLab](http://thegovlab.org/).
It requested that tell them about companies who are using open data
by filling out a questionnaire within two weeks (September 27).

On November 24, I saw a tweet about a
[strangely similar request](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/11/20/the-global-open-data-initiative-needs-your-input/)
from the Sunlight Foundation,
with the questionnaire due November 29.

## Sharing data to save time
These questionnaires are quite similar; could we (GovLab, Sunlight,
and people filling out questionnaires) maybe save some work if GovLab
and Sunlight shared the questionnaire data?

The questionnaires are not identical, so the questionnaire of one of
these groups might not satisfy the needs of the other, but I think it
would at least help.

## Open our data about open data
It's quite possible that Sunlight has seen GovLab's data. I hope they
have, as that probably would have saved some time. But even if they did,
I find it hilarious that **I** haven't seen the results of at least the
GovLab questionnaire.

Lots of people say that much of open data is about
[setting the default to open](http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/#open-by-default),
so you would think that raw results of these questionnaires would be published.
I guess Sunlight might want to wait until it closes the questionnaire before it
publishes anything, but GovLab could totally have released its data by now.

## Sharing data to get people to contribute data?
When I saw each of these questionnaires, I considered sending it to
people, but nine days didn't seem like enough time for it to be worth
me telling people about them.

Actually, that's not really true; that's what I say to myself, but
it's really an excuse; the real reason I didn't send them around is
that I'm generally quite skeptical that anyone is going to look
closely at the questionnaire. Assembling the questionnaire and
sending it out is a lot of work already; are they actually going
to have any energy left once they get the results back?

I wonder: Would opening the results of questionnaires would get me
to fill out the questionnaires?
