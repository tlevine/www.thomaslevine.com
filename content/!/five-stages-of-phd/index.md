In my categorical data analysis class (BTRY 6030), 
[Tom DiCiccio](http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/directory/tjd9/)
taught me much more than logistic regression.

On April 20, 2011, we learned about the five stages of PhD. They're

1. Naïve optimism
2. Vague anxiety
3. Complete dispair
4. I can't believe nobody's done it.
5. God I could have done this in five months.

Here's a picture of my notes from that day.
