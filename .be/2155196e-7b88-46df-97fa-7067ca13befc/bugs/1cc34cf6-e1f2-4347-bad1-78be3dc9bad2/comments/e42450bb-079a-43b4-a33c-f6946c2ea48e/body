Max told me of two cities with differently organized GIS groups.

Portland has a regional GIS office that keeps all of the maps
up-to-date for everything.

Boston has three people in the GIS group, and they teach everyone
to keep her maps-to-date.

Try detecting differences in organization like this in the open
GIS data from different cities.
